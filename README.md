## ♛ N-Queens Visualizer

This is a web-based visualizer for the classic **N-Queens Problem**, built using modern frontend technologies. This app demonstrates the backtracking algorithm as it places queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## 🧠 What is the N-Queens Problem?

The N-Queens problem is a well-known **combinatorial puzzle** where the goal is to place **N queens on an N×N chessboard** so that no two queens attack each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).
